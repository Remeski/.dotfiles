## Remeski dotfiles

### Requirements

- a Nerdfont installed
- oh-my-posh and oh-my-zsh

### Installing

#### oh-my-zsh

- Install zsh-autosuggestions plugin into plugins folder

#### tmux 

- Install TPM to tmux so that other plugins will load

#### After that

- `install.sh` will place soft links to correct places (if it works?)
- You are done. Just look that everything works and isn't a total shitshow (probly is but okay)
